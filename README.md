# Welcome to my personal profile page! ðŸš€

### About me:
I'm Victor, a passionate and aspiring front-end developer on a journey to turn ideas into interactive and visually appealing web experiences. Since 2019, I've been diving deep into the world of web development, exploring various technologies and frameworks to hone my skills and broaden my understanding of front-end development.

### My Journey:
My journey into the world of programming started in 2019, driven by a curiosity to understand how websites are built and a desire to create my own digital projects. Since then, I've been on a continuous learning path, immersing myself in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and popular front-end frameworks like React.js.

### What I'm Currently Doing:
I'm currently dedicated to sharpening my skills and knowledge in front-end development to make the leap into my first professional role. I'm actively working on personal projects, exploring new technologies, and contributing to open-source projects to strengthen my portfolio and gain real-world experience.

- These are some of the languages and tools I've worked on:
